# Wedding photos

A small React app to show off our wedding photos. Images are hosted on an AWS S3 bucket, loaded using React, and organised using Masonry.

## Notes to self

- Clone the repository
- `npm i` to install
- `npm run start` for development
- `npm run deploy` builds the site and pushes to the _gh-pages_ branch, updating the live site
